### This stacked bar chart visualizes the relationship between weight loss and hair loss. The x-axis represents 
### weight loss status (0 = No weight loss, 1 = Experienced weight loss), while the y-axis shows the proportion of individuals with and without hair loss.
### The chart helps identify whether weight loss is associated with increased hair loss. If the red portion is significantly larger for those 
### who experienced weight loss, it suggests a higher likelihood of hair loss due to weight loss.
