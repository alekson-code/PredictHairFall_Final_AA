### By comparing the bars for each age group, the chart helps identify trends in hair loss prevalence across different age ranges, 
showing whether hair loss is more common in certain age groups.

### # Smoking Status	No Hair Loss (0)	Hair Loss (1)
### 0 (Non-Smokers)	47.29%	52.71%
### 1 (Smokers)	52.99%	47.01%

## Comparison of Hair Loss by Weight Loss

### Weight Loss	No Hair Loss (0)	Hair Loss (1)
### 0 (No Weight Loss)	52.37%	47.63%
### 1 (Experienced Weight Loss)	47.88%	52.12%
### This stacked bar chart visualizes the relationship between weight loss and hair loss. The x-axis represents 
### weight loss status (0 = No weight loss, 1 = Experienced weight loss), while the y-axis shows the proportion of individuals with and without hair loss.
### The chart helps identify whether weight loss is associated with increased hair loss. If the red portion is significantly larger for those 
### who experienced weight loss, it suggests a higher likelihood of hair loss due to weight loss.

## Comparison of Hair Loss by Environmental Factors

### No Hair Loss (0)	Hair Loss (1)
### 0 (No Exposure)	49.29%	50.71%
### 1 (Exposed)	51.18%	48.82%
### This stacked bar chart illustrates the relationship between environmental factors and hair loss. The x-axis represents exposure to environmental 
### factors (0 = No exposure, 1 = Exposed), while the y-axis shows the proportion of individuals experiencing hair loss.
### Coolwarm colormap visually differentiates individuals with and without hair loss.
### The chart helps determine whether environmental factors (such as pollution, UV exposure, or chemicals) contribute to an increased risk 
### of hair loss. If the proportion of hair loss is significantly higher in the exposed group, it suggests a strong correlation between 
### environmental factors and hair health.
