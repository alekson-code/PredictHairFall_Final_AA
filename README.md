### # Smoking Status	No Hair Loss (0)	Hair Loss (1)
# 0 (Non-Smokers)	47.29%	52.71%
# 1 (Smokers)	52.99%	47.01%
# Description of the Chart: Hair Loss and Smoking Relationship
# The bar chart illustrates the relationship between smoking status and hair loss. The x-axis represents smoking status, 
# where 0 = Non-smokers and 1 = Smokers. The y-axis indicates the proportion of individuals experiencing hair loss versus those who do not.
# Each bar is divided into two stacked segments:
# Green (#2ca02c) represents individuals with no hair loss.
# Red (#d62728) represents individuals experiencing hair loss.
# From the chart, we can observe the proportional differences in hair loss prevalence between smokers and non-smokers. 
# If the red segment is significantly larger for smokers, it suggests a higher incidence of hair loss among smokers compared to non-smokers. 
# Conversely, if both groups show similar proportions, smoking may have a weaker correlation with hair loss.
# This visualization helps in understanding whether smoking is a potential risk factor for hair loss based
